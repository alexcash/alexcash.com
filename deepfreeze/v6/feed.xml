    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Comic book characters have made an indelible mark on me. The legacy of comics permeate our culture and populate some of my earliest memories. Episodes of Adam West’s Batman on a wood cabinet CRT television in my grandparents living room. An Incredible Hulk vinyl record picked up at a garage sale. A copy of Superman 3 on VHS. A pay per view rental of Batman and Robin on a family vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From middle school through to my adulthood comic book movies have boomed in popularity. In middle school, a copy of Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man passed around on CD-R. In high school taking a date to see Superman Returns, or a friend to see Batman Begins. In college, Iron Man and the Dark Knight. Since then, no less than 20 movies have been added to the Marvel cinematic universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As time passes the impact of comic books becomes ever more clear. The characters and worlds are more and more broadly accepted. We immitate the characters and stories as they immitate us. Comics are inextricably intertwined with our culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, I’ve never read comic books. At least not in earnest. I’ve had a couple short forays. I was briefly mail order subscribed to a monthly Sonic book when I was about six years old. I read a dark phoenix trade from a public library in middle school. When I was in college I read the Watchmen to prepare for the movie release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each time I enjoyed the experience, but each time I got distracted by something else, usually a glowing screen. For as important as the ideas have been to my life, comics remain somewhat exotic in my mind. Something I’ve heard much about and assume to be a great pleasure, but have never been able to focus myself enough to enjoy. I suspect this is true for most my age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to make an effort to step away from my phone and my computer and my game consoles. I found a local comic book shop, and I went. I picked up a trade and several new #1 issues. I’ve been reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to see where these characters and ideas that so capture our imagination come from. I want to see what this is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to say much more about &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; than has already been said. A game of it's cultural significance comes seldom and ink is liberally spilled. In that light I’ll keep it short and focus on extra perspective I can bring to the table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I very much enjoyed this game. In many ways it is the truest spiritual successor to &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;, a game which defined my childhood. It inherits the sense of exploration and joy in traversal more clearly than any other successor. The art is gorgeous, and I’m continually surprised at the visuals that handheld hardware can achieve on my 48” 1080p TV at a buttery smooth 60fps. The musical score is stellar and the real orchestral recordings continue to do the compositions justice. The controls are tight and responsive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../images/blog/mario-odyssey/wat.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the praise out of the way, a digression. It is sometimes posited in the gamer community that Nintendo games are reviewed on a curve — that you could subtract 10-20 points from any 100 point score and know the true quality of the game. I vociferously disagree with this notion. I truly believe &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; with all of it's faults is one of the best games ever made, and deserves every last perfect score and award nomination. To discount all games from a publisher or developer as overrated is narrow of focus and I dare say intellectually lazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; banks on it’s place in the Mario pantheon and the inherit franchise nostalgia so very frequently. Levels are chock full of things to find, but can often feel like a Banjo Kazooie magnitude collectathon. The possession mechanic works well most of the time, but is usually relegated to a quick 30 second portion of a kingdom and then forgotten. Retro 2D platforming sections are novel but lack any interesting level design in their own right. In my view, all of these faults are just aspects of the game trying to do too much. With more focus, I think it could be more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nostalgia spell totally worked on me. The music, the visuals, the call backs; they all truly felt like a grand celebration and I was on board. However, I do think opinions of the game are inflated. Perhaps &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; is the game that internet trolls have in mind when they talk about the Nintendo review score curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a perfect game. It is, however, a must play game. It doesn’t compare to the likes of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; in my mind, but it is more than worth the price of admission. It stands out on the growing list of great reasons to purchase a switch, and rounds out what has been a great year for the Nintendo gamer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- 8/10 --&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been playing BoxBoy! (3DS, 2015) in little hunks for the last month. It's a $5 digital only title develped by HAL Labratory of Super Smash Brothers fame. The game showed up on my radar when it's sequel "Bye Bye BoxBoy" was announced earlier this year. While covering it several of the gaming podcasts I listen to went out of their way to sing the original's praises, so I decided to give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept is novel. You're platforming as a little box that can generate and manipulate other little boxes. The idea is to use those boxes to avoid hazards and reach the end of each stage. As an extra challenge, there are rewards for getting to hard to reach locations, or using a particularly few numbers of boxes. This core mechanic is inventive and very enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../images/blog/boxboy/gameplay.gif" alt="A short video clip of gameplay" title="A short video clip of gameplay" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is split into 17 different worlds that share puzzle mechanic themes. Each mechanic is interesting and challenging in it's own right, and you feel clever after solving puzzles with them. Sometimes the mechanics layer on top of each other in fun ways, though this isn't as frequent as I would have liked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BoxBoy! exudses charm, and does so very much artistically with so very little. The environments are simple but fullly considered, aestheticaly pleasing and occasional use of particle effects or other visual tricks are gorgeous. The music is simple as well, but is friendly, welcoming, and rememborable - far above par for a eShop game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time flew playing this game – I thought for sure I'd played for 3-4 hours, but the gameplay log on my 3DS says I played for just about 6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../images/blog/boxboy/the-end.jpg" alt="A 3DS on the game end screen" title="A 3DS on the game end screen" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BoxBoy! is the bite sized game that every mobile title wishes it was. If you are into puzzles and like to jump into a game for just a few minutes at a time this title is a must. A+&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../images/blog/mario-galaxy-2/bowser.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played the original at launch 10 years ago. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but then went to college and missed this release completely. It’s hard to articulate but this sequel felt so very right. Familiar; not tired. Bright &amp;amp; jubilant; not saccharin. Something new around every corner, in the best possible way. Galaxy 1 &amp;amp; 2 are probably the pinnacle of 3D platforming to date. They stand together in my mind and are worthy of all praise received. If forced to critique I would say Galaxy 2 assumes you are a big fan coming back for more. Off the ‘happy path’ difficulty is quite high. 22 hours, but felt like 12. A joy to see and hear. It’s easily earns an A in my book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../images/blog/mario-galaxy-2/the-end.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came back to the series after a decade. I didn’t miss a beat and the game didn’t either. If you enjoy 3D Mario you gotta go back for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../images/blog/splatoon-2/screenshot.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15 hours of gameplay, roughly split between campaign and multiplayer. Campaign has neat ideas &amp;amp; challenges but attempts at variety make pacing poor. Zip through the best content, slog through some of the worst. Art is charming if repetitive. Sound will probably click as cute for some but podcasts were a must for me. Multiplayer will probably keep me coming back for a least a few more hours play. Splatfest was a ball, ranked modes have me intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../images/blog/splatoon-2/the-end.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I give it a B. Strong character and a good core loop with some flawed execution on top.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ok, this ones a little embarrassing but here it goes. Pokémon X (3DS, 2013)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../images/blog/pokemon-x/the-end.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good: stunning environments. Both artwork and engine give a sense of place and scale impressive for a handheld. The bad: everything else. Despite having the exact same core gameplay loop as 20 years ago it still took ~23 hours. New music is forgettable. Old music is nostalgic for a while but loops for hours. Attempt at a story is admirable but can be &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/DN9DW4rrEjY"&gt;summed up in 22 seconds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I hadn’t been shut in with a runny nose, and hadn’t the nostalgia been strong I wouldn’t have finished. I won’t be revisiting. C+.&lt;/p&gt;
