Food. Shelter. Clothing. It wasn't really meant for a journey such as this, but I
am confident that it will rise to the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="My Kawasaki Vulcan S" src="/images/blog/motocamp-2016/motorcycle-f231debf.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be using the original global positioning system to orienteer accross the country.
Through the Great Basin Desert. A quick stop off in Ogden, Utah. Yellowstone National Park.
The Bitterroot National Forest. The Sawtooth National Forest. Crater Lake. Juanita Lake.
Mad River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Paper Map" src="/images/blog/motocamp-2016/map-3dc2c43e.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll start with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pfhobia"&gt;one companion&lt;/a&gt;, but after just three
nights, I'll be going alone. Six days with the open road, and five nights with the stars 
in the sky. Plenty of time to think, to reflect. Time enough to miss home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Me and friends with our bikes" src="/images/blog/motocamp-2016/friends-30e9c298.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be camping six of the eight nights. Sleeping outside, cooking my own food. Roughing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tents" src="/images/blog/motocamp-2016/tents-3303b583.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've done short trips before. But nothing quite like this. I've spent much of today
going over my packing list, and going over it again. I'm anxious, and I miss my wife and
home already. But above all I'm excited. I'll learn more about myself. Either I'll have
a new annual tradition, or one hell of a story. I can't wait to set out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="An early version of my packing list" src="/images/blog/motocamp-2016/list-2d5b5240.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexcash"&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt; as I can, and you can see a map 
tracking my location (don't be creepy guys) along the way &lt;a href="http://share.findmespot.com/shared/faces/viewspots.jsp?glId=0qH20ST17Pxr1DsxXSTFrOFz5rjvRN3WB"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
If you have an iPhone and want in on a photo stream send me a message. I may write 
about it here again as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I made &lt;a href="/saving-on-wwdc"&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; enouraging people to consider going 
to WWDC, along with some tips on ways that you could save money doing so. I received
lots of positive feedback, and I heard from a few that they were going to register 
because of it. That's awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got some good advice from other bay area natives on twitter. On food budget:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexcash"&gt;@alexcash&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/caseyliss"&gt;@caseyliss&lt;/a&gt; What about free food in WWDC Parties?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Genady Okrain (@genadyo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/genadyo/status/723185729354891266"&gt;April 21, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glenn Fleishman suggests that perhaps you could find a roommate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;~&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jsnell"&gt;@jsnell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexcash"&gt;@alexcash&lt;/a&gt; I wonder if anyone’s set up a room share? A room with two beds = 1/2 cost if you can consider staying w/a new friend!&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Glenn Fleishman (@GlennF) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GlennF/status/723187360981090306"&gt;April 21, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a really neat idea for a website or app. A cool project someone could tackle next year.
For those still making plans this year, maybe we could use a hashtag. I suggest 
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;amp;q=%23WWDCRoommateSearch&amp;amp;src=typd"&gt;#WWDCRoommateSearch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For saving on transit &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CKWang/status/723191557134766080"&gt;Courtney Wang suggests&lt;/a&gt;
another taxi share similar to Uber pool called &lt;a href="https://www.lyft.com/line"&gt;Lyft line&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andreas Netzmann has had good luck staying at a hotel near SFO for the week of WWDC:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jsnell"&gt;@jsnell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexcash"&gt;@alexcash&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davedelong"&gt;@davedelong&lt;/a&gt; The Dylan at SFO in Millbrae is decent, I took Caltrain from their to WWDC &amp;#39;13&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andreas Netzmann (@netzmann) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netzmann/status/723208621455237121"&gt;April 21, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyle S. recommends against Caltrain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thequinntaylor"&gt;@thequinntaylor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jsnell"&gt;@jsnell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexcash"&gt;@alexcash&lt;/a&gt; A friend regrets staying on the Peninsula last year. Inside the BART region might be workable compromise.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Kyle S. (@optshiftk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/optshiftk/status/723390406327586817"&gt;April 22, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other experience to share, or ideas you think people should try, 
send them my way and I'll keep this post updated. Nothing would make me more happy 
than if our tips enabled someone to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you're a developer for Apple platforms, you've undoubtedly seen &lt;a href="http://www.joecieplinski.com/blog/2016/04/19/conferences-get-together-for-a-special-offer/"&gt;some of the discussion&lt;/a&gt;
over the last few days about the cost of WWDC. With each year popularity of the conference
increases and so too does demand for tickets. Apple announces the conference
later and later, leaving less time for planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manton Reece &lt;a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/04/dont-give-up-on-wwdc.html"&gt;encourages us&lt;/a&gt; 
to not give up on WWDC and think of other creative ways to save cost:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I think it’s possible to go out to WWDC without spending a fortune. You can attend AltConf, 
find an Airbnb room for $150/night, and stay a few days instead of all week. I downgraded 
my expectations for WWDC and booked a cheaper hotel room a couple of months ago. It’s 
about how much you want to be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Gruber &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/04/20/reece-wwdc"&gt;followed up&lt;/a&gt;
 on Manton's thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The problem with Manton’s idea is that there aren’t many Airbnb options within a walkable 
distance of Moscone. (Even if you don’t have a conference ticket, most of the social 
stuff you might want to attend is in the general area of SOMA or Union Square.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I can point out a few more ways to save cost, including those specific to the Bay Area. I've 
only lived here for about four years, so I'm no expert, but I do have some ideas that may 
be helpful to atendees looking to cut costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="hotels"&gt;Hotels&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting a hotel outside of the City proper is a huge savings. This morning,
I was quoted $183 a night at the Oakland Airport Hilton for the week of WWDC. Checking in Sunday
evening, and checking out Friday morning, you'd have accomidations covered for $915. This is a steal compared
to the $2500 &lt;a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2016/4/20/much-ado-about-wwdc"&gt;Casey Liss estimates&lt;/a&gt; he's going to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also quoted $185 for a Best Western in Redwood City. $140 for a Hampton Inn in Hayward.
For a Best Western near the Oakland airport I was quoted $160 a night. All of these hotels were
walking distance to train stations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="transit"&gt;Transit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="BART Map" src="/images/blog/saving-on-wwdc/system-map-618b1300.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bart.gov/"&gt;BART&lt;/a&gt; is our public train system. It's underground in the 
city and above ground in the burbs. Moscone is just three blocks from the Powell 
Street station, and the Bill Graham auditorium is just two blocks from the Civic Center station. 
 I attended WWDC last year taking the BART each day to Moscone, and then back to
my home each night in Fremont. It took me about 45 minutes each way and the 
fare was about $60 for the week. If you were riding the train from Daly city or 
Oakland the ride would be shorter, and the fare lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other transit options as well, though I must admit I am less familiar. &lt;a href="https://www.sfmta.com/"&gt;The Muni&lt;/a&gt;
bus system is fairly cheap and goes all over the city. &lt;a href="https://help.uber.com/h/5d3fa7d0-9831-4ead-b4f4-0299eb443ea2"&gt;Uber pool&lt;/a&gt;
is a good way to save cash on a cab. &lt;a href="http://www.caltrain.com/"&gt;Caltrain&lt;/a&gt; hooks up with BART 
if you want to do transit from the peninsula. The train switch adds a little time, but you could 
stay in suburbs like Redwood City, Palo Alto, or Mountain View.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="alternative-airports"&gt;Alternative Airports&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bay Area Airports" src="/images/blog/saving-on-wwdc/airports-907d120f.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way I save cost when traveling back to the midwest is looking at all of the
bay area airports. I like flying Oakland (OAK) because it's simple and easy to hop on
public transit. It's also worth considering San Jose (SJC), though
you'll need to find a ride. These other airports have different connecting options
and are usually a little bit less busy. You can probably find a deal flying in to one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="food"&gt;Food&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conference food is never glamorous, and WWDC is no exception. However, there are always
pastries and juices in the morning, and boxed lunch provided around noon. You can probably
pack along some meals with you, or hit a grocery store while you are here. It may not be the
healthiest or most satisfying, but it's definitely cheaper than eating out every meal for the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="scholarship"&gt;Scholarship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple provides &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships/"&gt;scholarships&lt;/a&gt; every year, helping
people attend who may not be able to otherwise. If you are a student or a member of a 
STEM organization, it's worth looking into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="get-creative"&gt;Get Creative&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know none of these things are overly convenient. I hadn't thought of it at first, but I also definitely
understand that some of this can be intimidating if you aren't from a big city (I grew up in Missouri).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexcash"&gt;@alexcash&lt;/a&gt; sure. But your average outsider won’t feel confident on the Bart. I didn’t ride it for the first year or two.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Casey Liss (@caseyliss) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/caseyliss/status/722911672336121856"&gt;April 20, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just hate the idea of someone counting themselves out because of cost. Especially if they don't 
know all of their options. WWDC is an incredibly enriching experience I recommend for any
Apple developer. If you are considering attending I encourage you to be creative, and try to
find a way to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;: I've written a &lt;a href="/crowd-sourced-wwdc-tips"&gt;small followup&lt;/a&gt; with some crowd sourced tips.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just over a year ago, I started hacking in my spare time on a little game. Nights
and weekends when I got a wild hair, I'd sit in front of a glowing screen until
the sun came up. I wrote a lot of code. I threw a lot of code away. I learned a 
lot about rendering, and real time systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effort and time that went into it may not be immediately evident. It's a 
simple game with a simple premise. You'll easily jump through each mode and get
a feeling for exactly what it is in just a few minutes. It's not a major technological 
achievement, it's not a piece of art, and it's game design is not groundbreaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you spend some extra time with it, you may find the same appreciation
for it that I have. It features a wonderful soundtrack courtesy of &lt;a href="http://luckylionstudios.com/"&gt;Lucky Lion Studios&lt;/a&gt;. 
All of the graphics and menus are procedurally drawn. It should be easy to 
pick up, but hard to master. I tried hard to make it cohesive, refined, and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's called Ecliptic, and it's free on the App Store today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style="height:50px; width: 100%;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ecliptic/id729679099?mt=8"&gt;&lt;img src="../images/blog/accidental-game/appstore.svg" style="height: 100%;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm super fortunate to have the opportunity to share it with the world. This game 
would not have happened without a great many people. I have an awesome partnership 
with &lt;a href="http://www.room12studios.com/"&gt;Room 12 Studios&lt;/a&gt;; they are publishing the 
game, coordinated music and sound effects, took care of all the messy paper work, 
beta tested, as well as provided feedback and direction. I'm lucky to have a day 
job at a company that released the copyright for all of my work on the game and 
encouraged me to release it. I've got the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; wife, who puts up with a tired, 
bleary eyed husband most every Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to support me, and if you'd like to see more games like Ecliptic, 
purchase the theme pack from the settings menu for just $0.99. You can also
purchase Room 12's previous app &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ipredict-plus-fortune-teller/id471505464?mt=8"&gt;iPredict&lt;/a&gt; 
which got an update today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I made a screen recording for a friend, explaining how to do a few
technical tasks. I was listening to Recess, Skrillex's latest album, while I
worked. Occasionally I had to download a large file, or compile some source code,
and I would get up and walk away from the computer. In order to keep the videos
digestible I later dropped them into iMovie and created a few time lapse effects in
sections where I waited for my computer to do it's thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back over the edited recording, I discovered something wonderful. Skrillex
at 20 times it's regular speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;audio src="../images/blog/skrillex-at-20x/recess.mp3" controls=""&gt;

The entire album is only 2:13 when played back at this speed. Some songs still
sound like music. Others sound like they belong in Wargames, or Tron. Some sound
like they came from Frogger or Pac Man. Others just sound like noise.

Regardless, I think it's fascinating. And worth a listen.

&lt;p&gt;In my case, I wanted to experiment with the forbidden fruit of Android. Google
and Sprint have a &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/googlevoice/sprint/"&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; that
allows you to connect your phone number to Google voice without violating your
cell contract and incurring an early termination fee. I thought I'd
take advantage of that. My plan was to keep my iPhone, but forward calls and SMS
to my new Moto X, allowing me to carry whichever phone struck my fancy on a
given day. I figured the risk was pretty low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a week before my new Android phone arrived, I decided to start weening myself
off of Apple services slowly. I migrated my Tweetbot tweet syncing from iCloud to
Tweet Marker, my emails from iCloud to Gmail, my podcasts to pocket casts. It all
went pretty smooth. Until it came time to turn off iMessage. After a quick search,
the most &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ts5185"&gt;prominent answer&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be that
I simply needed to turn off iMessage in my iPhones settings. So that's what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwords, I went back to the messages app and sent a friend an SMS. 'Test' it
read. It sent just fine, so I assumed all was well. I pocketed my phone and went on
with my day. Later, I met my friend for lunch and asked after the text message I had
sent. "Oh yeah, I responded. Didn't you get it?" Uh oh. I asked to see his iPhone,
and navigated to his messages app. 'It's working' he had replied. The reassuring
&lt;em&gt;delivered&lt;/em&gt; text sat beneath the message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just when I thought I was out… they pull me back in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say I was pretty upset. If my wife or parents had tried to contact
me for some sort of emergency, I never would have gotten that message. Not only
that, but they would have thought everything was hunky dory. It says 'delivered'
right there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began the search for a solution online. Some people suggested logging into the
Apple support profile website, and deregistering devices (if you had even bothered registering)
for AppleCare and Apple support. Some suggested calling up AppleCare and talking
to a representative to try and resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few people mentioned that you need to log out of iMessage on every device that
had previously been set up to send and receive iMessages from your phone number.
Needless to say, this is a terribly flawed system. I logged out on my Mac which
I had access to, but my iPad was at home. I worried about all the past devices
I had sold or recycled that had been signed in. My iPhone 4, my 3GS. If the phone
number belongs to the phone, why can I continue to use it as an iMessage handle
on other devices? What if my contract with Sprint lapsed, and they assigned my
number to someone else? Would I still receive iMessage at that number if I failed
to sign out my iPad? Why hadn't my phone &lt;em&gt;told&lt;/em&gt; me that I'd need to sign out
other devices?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I complained about this to my coworkers for the better part of an hour, as I am
wont to do. After a while, someone suggested changing the password on my iCloud
account. The solution seemed so simple, I almost felt stupid. I went to icloud.com,
and set a new password there. All of my devices were logged out of iCloud, and I
was immediately able to send and receive SMS like normal on my iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't fathom why someone decided it should work this way. I don't know why there
isn't better messaging in the UI. I don't understand how a support article was
written that didn't explain the need to log out of all devices. My mind is absolutely
blown that a solution as simple as changing the password wasn't the first hit on
Google search. I wonder how many people attempt to get out of iMessage and fail,
or worse don't realize they aren't receiving messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not bitter though.&lt;/p&gt;
