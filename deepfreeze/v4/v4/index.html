  	<h1>v4.0</h1>
  	<h2>2013/01/19</h2>
    <p>For almost a year, this site has served as both an example of my skills, and a proving ground to hone them. Since the begining, I promised myself I&#8217;d frequently itterate upon it, forcing myself to grow and learn. Today is the next step on that path. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>New look and feel.</strong> Fully responsive, clean and lightweight.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>A blog!</strong> As a senior at Graceland, I created and maintained a small wordpress blog at binarysmokesignals.com. Now that I&#8217;m graduated, I wanted provide a more personal platform to share thoughts and writings. Now you can find posts right here at alexcash.com. Posts that I felt were relevant have made the migration from binary smoke signals. Others did not. I&#8217;m looking forward to writing more here in the future.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Complete code rewrite.</strong> Over the last months, I&#8217;ve become a bit of a tools snob. I went from just slamming out html and css in a text editor in v3, to a full blown tool chain for v4. The site is staticly generated using <a href='http://middlemanapp.com/'>middleman</a> and <a href='http://sass-lang.com/'>sass</a>. You can see the <a href='https://github.com/alexcash/alexcash.com'>source</a> on github. I&#8217;m pretty proud of it.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>alexca.sh short domain.</strong> A few months ago I aquired this URL, and with 4.0 it will provide short links to all my blog posts, and future pages of interest.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>New server architecture.</strong> I recently made the jump from a traditional apache server at dreamhost to cloud fronted nginx instance through AWS. Page loads should be stupid fast.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Design retrospective.</strong> My code has been out in the public since 1.0, and you can jump through the commit history on <a href='https://github.com/alexcash/alexcash.com'>github</a> to see my progress. However, I wanted to provide a simpler way for people to see how far I&#8217;ve come. So, on my home page I&#8217;ve provided a <a href='/#timeline'>timeline</a> with images of alexcash.com at every major revision. Click or tap through to see a &#8216;deep freeze&#8217; copy of that version of the site.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The web should be beautiful, funcitonal, clear, and concise. I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed my efforts so far. Join me as I work to contribute to that future.</p>
