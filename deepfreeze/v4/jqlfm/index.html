  	<h2>2013/02/10</h2>
    <p>Recently, I discoverd a script one of my new coworkers wrote for <a href='http://www.number61.net/about/'>his website</a> called <a href='https://github.com/mgipp/Rdio-Tiles'>rdio tiles</a> that showed artwork for music from his &#8216;heavy rotation&#8217; on rdio. I thought this was so cool. What better way to share more about yourself than a visual example of the music you&#8217;re currently into? It&#8217;s the perfect addition to this site &#8211; I started searching for a way to do it right away.</p>

<p>Being the curmudgeon I am, I&#8217;m not quite ready to pay a monthly fee for music. I&#8217;ve been working on my mp3 library for over a decade, and I&#8217;ve grown quite attached to iTunes. Enter <a href='http://www.last.fm/'>last.fm</a>. Last.fm has provided a service called scrobbling since 2002. By installing a simple app on my mac, I started logging(scrobbling) every song I listened to in iTunes up to Last.fm servers. Then, all of that data is available to me via a simple API.</p>

<p>I leveraged this to write a jQuery function to create a grid of album artwork for the top albums I&#8217;ve been listening to lately. I also put together some 3d css animations to go with the detail views. After spending a while on this I realized others might want this functionality too. So I turned into a jQuery plugin, and open sourced it under the MIT and GPL licenses. If you&#8217;d like to incorporate this into your site, or contribute to making the plugin better, check out the <a href='http://alexcash.github.com/jQuery.last.fm/'>project site</a>, or fork <a href='https://github.com/alexcash/jQuery.last.fm'>the project</a> on github.</p>
