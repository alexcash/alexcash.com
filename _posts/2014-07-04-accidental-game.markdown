Just over a year ago, I started hacking in my spare time on a little game. Nights
and weekends when I got a wild hair, I'd sit in front of a glowing screen until
the sun came up. I wrote a lot of code. I threw a lot of code away. I learned a 
lot about rendering, and real time systems.

The effort and time that went into it may not be immediately evident. It's a 
simple game with a simple premise. You'll easily jump through each mode and get
a feeling for exactly what it is in just a few minutes. It's not a major technological 
achievement, it's not a piece of art, and it's game design is not groundbreaking.


However, if you spend some extra time with it, you may find the same appreciation
for it that I have. It features a wonderful soundtrack courtesy of [Lucky Lion Studios](http://luckylionstudios.com/). 
All of the graphics and menus are procedurally drawn. It should be easy to 
pick up, but hard to master. I tried hard to make it cohesive, refined, and beautiful.

It's called Ecliptic, and it's free on the App Store today.

I'm super fortunate to have the opportunity to share it with the world. This game 
would not have happened without a great many people. I have an awesome partnership 
with [Room 12 Studios](http://www.room12studios.com/); they are publishing the 
game, coordinated music and sound effects, took care of all the messy paper work, 
beta tested, as well as provided feedback and direction. I'm lucky to have a day 
job at a company that released the copyright for all of my work on the game and 
encouraged me to release it. I've got the _best_ wife, who puts up with a tired, 
bleary eyed husband most every Saturday morning.

If you'd like to support me, and if you'd like to see more games like Ecliptic, 
purchase the theme pack from the settings menu for just $0.99. You can also
purchase Room 12's previous app [iPredict](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ipredict-plus-fortune-teller/id471505464?mt=8) 
which got an update today.
