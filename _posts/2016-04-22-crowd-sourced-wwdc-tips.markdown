Yesterday, I made [a post](/saving-on-wwdc) enouraging people to consider going 
to WWDC, along with some tips on ways that you could save money doing so. I received
lots of positive feedback, and I heard from a few that they were going to register 
because of it. That's awesome!

I also got some good advice from other bay area natives on twitter. On food budget:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/alexcash">@alexcash</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/caseyliss">@caseyliss</a> What about free food in WWDC Parties?</p>&mdash; Genady Okrain (@genadyo) <a href="https://twitter.com/genadyo/status/723185729354891266">April 21, 2016</a></blockquote>

Glenn Fleishman suggests that perhaps you could find a roommate:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">~<a href="https://twitter.com/jsnell">@jsnell</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/alexcash">@alexcash</a> I wonder if anyoneâ€™s set up a room share? A room with two beds = 1/2 cost if you can consider staying w/a new friend!</p>&mdash; Glenn Fleishman (@GlennF) <a href="https://twitter.com/GlennF/status/723187360981090306">April 21, 2016</a></blockquote>

This is a really neat idea for a website or app. A cool project someone could tackle next year.
For those still making plans this year, maybe we could use a hashtag. I suggest 
[#WWDCRoommateSearch](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23WWDCRoommateSearch&src=typd)

For saving on transit [Courtney Wang suggests](https://twitter.com/CKWang/status/723191557134766080)
another taxi share similar to Uber pool called [Lyft line](https://www.lyft.com/line).

Andreas Netzmann has had good luck staying at a hotel near SFO for the week of WWDC:

Kyle S. recommends against Caltrain:

Inside the BART region might be workable compromise.</p>&mdash; Kyle S. (@optshiftk) <a href="https://twitter.com/optshiftk/status/723390406327586817">April 22, 2016</a></blockquote>

If you have any other experience to share, or ideas you think people should try, 
send them my way and I'll keep this post updated. Nothing would make me more happy 
than if our tips enabled someone to attend.
