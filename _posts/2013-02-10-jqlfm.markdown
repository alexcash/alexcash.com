Recently, I discovered a script one of my new coworkers wrote for [his website](http://www.number61.net/about/) called [rdio tiles](https://github.com/mgipp/Rdio-Tiles) that showed artwork for music from his 'heavy rotation' on rdio. I thought this was so cool. What better way to share more about yourself than a visual example of the music you're currently into? It's the perfect addition to this site -- I started searching for a way to do it right away.

Being the curmudgeon I am, I'm not quite ready to pay a monthly fee for music. I've been working on my mp3 library for over a decade, and I've grown quite attached to iTunes. Enter [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/). Last.fm has provided a service called scrobbling since 2002. By installing a simple app on my mac, I started logging(scrobbling) every song I listened to in iTunes up to Last.fm servers. Then, all of that data is available to me via a simple API.

I leveraged this to write a jQuery function to create a grid of album artwork for the top albums I've been listening to lately. I also put together some 3d css animations to go with the detail views. After spending a while on this I realized others might want this functionality too. So I turned into a jQuery plugin, and open sourced it under the MIT and GPL licenses. If you'd like to incorporate this into your site, or contribute to making the plugin better, check out the [project site](http://alexcash.github.com/jQuery.last.fm/), or fork [the project](https://github.com/alexcash/jQuery.last.fm) on github.

If you aren't the developer type, just check out the demo below.
