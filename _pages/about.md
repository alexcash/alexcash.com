Hey. I'm Alex Cash. This is my digital home. Here you can find links to other places I am on the interwebs and some of my musings. I suppose this page specifically is where you can find a little more about me too.

### Origin

I grew up in Kansas City metro area. My primary interests were always computers and music. I don't have a ton of record of my computing escapades, but I was checking out (and reading!) books on BASIC from the library as early as third grade. Around that time my parents helped me buy computer parts ([AMD K6-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_K6-2), [ATI All In Wonder 128 Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-in-Wonder)) one at a time to build my own computer. In Middle School I took out a loan to buy a 12" PowerBook G4([1ghz, Superdrive](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook_g4/specs/powerbook_g4_1.0_12.html)). I mowed lawns for three years to pay it off.

Which leads me to a crazy story. After purchasing the Powerbook (2004?) I briefly wrote for a blog that wanted to compete with [Spymac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spymac) and [MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com). We pumped out fake iPod leaks like crazy, but if I recall correctly we had opinion pieces too. I did it under a pseudonym that I don't recall (maybe acecash??) and I don't recall the name of the website either. My email at the time was hosted on either [Juno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_Online_Services) or (I shit you not) [eskimobob.com](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/EskimoBob). I know it sounds like some 'my girlfriend lives in Canada' shit, but I swear to christ it's true. If I recall correctly I got into it via DMs on a forum (Spymac?) and the site runner I was writting for went by (I _think_) "Luigi Masai". I'd love to find some wayback machine links so if anyone remembers anything about it I beg you to let me know.

There is some digital footprint for my music, however. I loved marching band, and [in 2005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtnjoAFcDd8) I was in the Macy's Thanksgiving day parade. I also had a [shitty ska band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PqwXMIZltw).

### Work

Professionally, I'm a software engineer. I attended [Graceland Univeristy](https://www.graceland.edu) from 2008 to 2012, receving a B.S. in Computer Science and Information Technology. I interned with [Pioneer Hi Bred](https://www.pioneer.com) in 2011.

In 2012, I interned with [Nest Labs](https://web.archive.org/web/20121017084020/http://www.nest.com/) and was subsequently hired on full time. I was at Nest for five years, working on many projects. For the second generation theremostat, I rewrote the web tool that help prospective customers find out if their HVAC system was compatible. For the third generation thermostat, I worked on a (very) small team to take the nest.com marketing website in house, moving from wordpress (and duct tape) to a [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) static site. For the smoke detector, I worked on the web app (home.nest.com) which allowed you to control and monitor our devices from your web browser. I then moved on to the iOS team. I worked on redesigning the UI (we called it version 5.0), folding in DropCam (we aquired them, and renamed it Nest Cam), writing our watchOS and tvOS apps.

In 2017, I left Nest and joined my current employer. Some kind of fruit company or somehting like that. Eventually, when I've moved on I'll share more.

### Play

I play video games to pass the time. [I write about it](/tag/gaming/) here occasionally. I'd classify myself as casual, but I **_did_** raid in World of Warcraft for 10 years. I was a [paladin healer](https://youtu.be/uWNd-bRRBvY) for the guild [Dulce Bellum](http://www.dulcebellum.com\]), rest in pepperoni. Very recently I've gotten into modifying and restoring retro video game consoles. I've been working on my soldering skills. I hope to share about that here soon.

One of my cousins is huge on motorcycles, and he passed that bug on to me. I've been on several moto-camping trips including two big ones to [yellowstone]({% post_url 2016-07-22-motocamp-2016 %}) and El Paso. I've only written about it once here, but perhaps I'll do more in the future.

In 2018, with the Marvel Cinematic Universe at a fever pitch I decided to [try out comic books]({% post_url 2018-08-24-adventures-in-comics %}). I've fallen [way far down](https://mastodon.social/@alexcash/109243476257069735) that rabbit hole. I hope to write about that more here, but suffice to say I went and started a podcast about comics. It's called [Bat Lessons](https://batlessons.com) and it's about the history of Batman. Shouts out to my good friend [Brian](https://briananders.net) for being my cohost.

### Family

I don't want to share too much online, but family is deeply important to me. I've been happily married for 10 years, and I have a wonderful toddler. After living in the San Francisco Bay Area for 10 years, I returned to Kansas City in 2022. Having my son be near his grandparents has made all the difference in the world.
