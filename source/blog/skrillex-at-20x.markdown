Yesterday I made a screen recording for a friend, explaining how to do a few
technical tasks. I was listening to Recess, Skrillex's latest album, while I
worked. Occasionally I had to download a large file, or compile some source code,
and I would get up and walk away from the computer. In order to keep the videos
digestible I later dropped them into iMovie and created a few time lapse effects in
sections where I waited for my computer to do it's thing.

Going back over the edited recording, I discovered something wonderful. Skrillex
at 20 times it's regular speed.

The entire album is only 2:13 when played back at this speed. Some songs still
sound like music. Others sound like they belong in Wargames, or Tron. Some sound
like they came from Frogger or Pac Man. Others just sound like noise.

Regardless, I think it's fascinating. And worth a listen.
