title: "v4.0"

For almost a year, this site has served as both an example of my skills, and a proving ground to hone them. Since the begining, I promised myself I'd frequently itterate upon it, forcing myself to grow and learn. Today is the next step on that path. Here's what's new:

- **alexca.sh short domain.** A few months ago I aquired this URL, and with 4.0 it will provide short links to all my blog posts, and future pages of interest.

- **A blog!** During my senior year at Graceland, I created and maintained a small blog at binarysmokesignals.com. Now that I'm graduated, I wanted provide a more personal platform to share thoughts and writings. So now you can find posts right here at alexcash.com. Posts that I felt were relevant have made the migration from binary smoke signals. Others did not. I'm looking forward to writing more here in the future.

- **New server architecture.** I recently made the jump from a traditional apache server at dreamhost to CDN backed nginx instance through AWS. I'm planning on writing a blog about this transition soon.

- **Complete code rewrite.** Over the last months, I've become a bit of a tools snob. I went from just slamming out html and css in a text editor in v3, to a full blown tool chain for v4. I use middleman for static site generation, SASS and Compass for css precompilation, and I've got many more tricks up my sleeve too. You can see the source on github, and I plan on bloging more about it soon.

- **Design retrospective.** My code has been out in the public since 1.0, and you can always go back and see the progression over time. However, I wanted to provide a way for people to see truly how far I've come. So, on my home page I've provided a timeline with images of alexcash.com at every version. In the future, I'd like to have fully host versions you can browse as well.
 
The web should be beautiful, funcitonal, clear, and concise. I hope you've enjoyed my efforts so far. Join me as I work to contribute to that future.
