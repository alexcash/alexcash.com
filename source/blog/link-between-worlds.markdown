The first post in my videogame backlog series. I'll post here when I beat a game I've been meaning to get to. All screenshots are my own.
Today is "The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds" for the Nintendo 3DS, relased in 2013.

There are other really great screenshots, but you know. Spoilers.

A+ musical score. Above average story for Zelda. Nostalgia to the max. ~16 hours play time. Will definitely revisit.
