Sunday afternoon, HTC kicked off <a href="http://www.binarysmokesignals.com/?p=29">MWC</a> with a <a href="http://www.bgr.com/2012/02/26/live-from-htcs-mwc-2012-press-conference/">keynote</a> showing off their new <a href="http://www.htc.com/us/products/htconex-att">'One' line</a> of phones. One of the less talked about announcements to come out of the keynote is that all Sense 4.0 (this includes the one series) devices will ship with <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/htc-and-dropbox-team-offer-25gb-storage-all-sense-40-devices">25GB of dropbox</a> storage free for 2 years. This comes about the same time that Dropbox has <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2400722,00.asp">introduced </a>automatic photo uploading from it's android app. It seems clear that Dropbox is making moves to become an integral part of how people use their phones.

 

But what does this mean? Dropbox has clearly been able to get in on the ground floor of a new generation of technology. In the future, people will only be wanting to store more and more of their things online, and being the first solution has paid Dropbox dividends. Even though start up competitors like <a href="http://box.com/">Box.com</a> are providing more storage, and have <a href="http://blog.box.com/2012/02/android-users-get-50gb-free-get-your-box50gb-and-enter-the-box-mobile-giveaway/">aggressive marketing</a> it <a href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-08-24/tech/29979807_1_cloud-storage-dropbox-backup-service">hasn't seemed to hurt</a> Dropbox. However, <a href="http://gigaom.com/author/gigabarb/">Barb Darrow</a> posted <a href="http://gigaom.com/cloud/dropbox-disruptor-or-flash-in-the-pan/#react-tabs">an article</a> on Gigaom Monday that poses some really interesting questions regarding the future of the Dropbox. The first wave of competitors has been easy to fend off, but quickly coming down the pipeline are cloud storage solutions from <a href="http://www.apple.com/icloud/">Apple</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/storage/">Google</a>, <a href="http://explore.live.com/skydrive">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/clouddrive/learnmore">Amazon</a>.

 

In the Gigaom article, Barb is quick to point out that the best technology or feature sets don't always win out, citing the victory of VHS over Betamax. While this is an apt analogy, I'd probably compare the potential future of Dropbox to Blu-Ray's victory over HD-DVD. While the assessment of 'better technology' doesn't necessarily apply, what rings very true is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/800_lb_gorilla">800 pound gorilla effect</a>. Back in 2007, Sony wanted the HD movie distribution market, so they poured money into it until they owned it. It seems clear that the largest companies in tech today want the cloud market, and are <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/apple-icloud-harmony-ad-launches-27215735/">willing to pay</a> to get it.

 

So how does Dropbox win? They need to get everyone to rely on their service, and fast. As soon as users have all of their data stored with one service, it's going to be hard to get them to switch. Partnerships like the one announced with HTC are the ones companies are going to have to make. If devices in the future ship to new cloud users offering integration to other services out of the box, the days for Dropbox are numbered. The move to try and grab the mobile market before it's too late it is a smart one.
