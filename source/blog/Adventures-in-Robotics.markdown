I'm in my Senior year at [Graceland University](http://graceland.edu/), and this year I'm president of our [ACM chapter](http://csit.graceland.edu/acm/acm.html). Each year we travel to several different conferences, and for the last several years we have been traveling to the Midwest Instruction and Computing Symposium or [MICS](http://www.micsymposium.org/). Part of the conference each year is a Robotics competition. In 2011, about 26 teams of 2-3 students worked on [a problem](http://www2.css.edu/mics/RoboMazeMICS_2011.pdf) that involved traversing a maze built of black tiles and white tape walls. [Brian Anders](http://personal.graceland.edu/~bsanders/) and I had never competed in robotics competition, but decided to put together a solution. We ended up taking home second place! The video following illustrates:

The source code for this solution can be found on [my github](https://github.com/alexcash/Robotics-Solutions). The reason this comes to mind is because we are competing again tomorrow. I don't want to give out too many details on the competition or our solution before the competition is over, but here is a video to tide you over:
