        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>The web should be a beautiful place. It's my job not just to facilitate interactions, deliver content, or write code. It's also my job to make my user's experiences delightful. While I pride myself in being able to make a professional design come to life, I also push myself to craft entire experiences from beginning to end. Better understanding design makes me a better engineer.</p>

        <h2>Code</h2>
        <p>Like any good craftsmen, I believe a good developer must love his tools. Whether it's html, css, or javascript, I want to be an expert on good engineering practice and paths to productivity in front end development. Before being a web professional, I developed for iOS. I did the engineering work for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ipredict-lite-fortune-teller/id406282919?mt=8">iPredict</a>, an app downloaded over a million times, with the good guys at <a href="http://www.room12studios.com/">Room 12 Studios</a>.</p>

        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>I'm a front end engineer at <a href="http://nest.com/">Nest</a>. I love my job. I get to work every day on creating web experiences to delight. Previously, I had the opportunity to intern with <a href="http://www.pioneer.com/landing">Pioneer Hi-Bred</a>. At Pioneer, I worked with iOS and Microsoft .NET. In May of 2012, I graduated from Graceland University with a degree in Computer Science and Information Technology. At Graceland, I was our <a href="http://www.acm.org/">ACM</a> chapter president.</p>

        <h2>Play</h2>
        <p>In my free time I like to hone my design and development skills. This site is an example of some of that work. I play World of Warcraft, where I raid in the guild <a href="http://www.dulcebellum.com">&lt; Dulce Bellum &gt;</a> on Stonemaul-US. When I'm not in front of a glowing screen I like to spend my time geocaching with my wife on trails and in parks accross the country.</p>
